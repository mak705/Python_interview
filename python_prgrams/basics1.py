'''Arithmetic
Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should compute and
display:
• The sum of a and b
• The difference when b is subtracted from a
• The product of a and b
• The quotient when a is divided by b
• The remainder when a is divided by b
• The result of ab
